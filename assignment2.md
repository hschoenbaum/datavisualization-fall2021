# Assignment 2

## Are there more operating D.C. traffic cameras ticketing drivers in neighborhoods with a higher demographic of low-income people of color?

### Hannah Schoenbaum

**Summary**

*What has been done before?*

The most significant coverage of racial disparities in D.C.’s traffic camera usage comes from a detailed 2018 study by research fellow William Farrell of the D.C. Policy Center, titled [“Predominately black neighborhoods in D.C. bear the brunt of automated traffic enforcement.”](https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/predominately-black-neighborhoods-in-d-c-bear-the-brunt-of-automated-traffic-enforcement/) In this study they author argues that "given the District’s high degree of residential racial segregation, decisions about where and how to use 'neutral' technology like speed cameras can still have a disparate impact in terms of outcomes." The D.C. Policy Center analyzed moving violation citations and crash data and concluded that census tracts with higher proportions of black residents were associated with a higher incidence of traffic fines, despite not experiencing a greater number of car crashes.

The earliest article I found on this topic, [“Are Traffic Cameras Racist?”](https://dcist.com/story/06/06/08/are-traffic-cam/) from the dcist, dates back to 2006. This story is mostly speculative and is not well sourced, but it is the first mention of residents complaining that traffic cameras were disproportionately located in the city’s African American neighborhoods.

**Data Sets**

[Automated Traffic Enforcement Camera Locations](https://ddot.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ddot/publication/attachments/ATEB%20active%20locations%2009.01.2021%5B17%5D.pdf)

*District Department of Transportation (September 2021)*

This data set includes a list of all active Automated Photo Enforcement Cameras in the District, inlcuding cameras for red light enforcment, speed enforcement, stop signs and oversized vehicles, as of Sept. 1, 2021. This is the most recent data on traffic camera locations from the DDOT. This data set is trustworthy because it comes directly from the source and contains the most recently updated data available.

[District of Columbia Census Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/DC)

We can use Census data to look at the ethnic breakdown of D.C. districts and compare the data to that of other years and other major cities. Census data is typically the most trustworthy source for demographic data and can allow us to compare different sets of data to show demographic changes over time.

[Crashes in DC](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crashes-in-dc)

*Open Data DC*

This data set and interactive map log all of the car crash locations and details of each crash in the District. The data set is updated daily to include all new crash data. This data is trustworthy because it comes directly from the DDOT and is regularly updated. This data source was the same one used in the D.C. Policy Center study I referenced above.
