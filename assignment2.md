**Summary**

*What has been done before?*

The earliest article I found on this topic, [“Are Traffic Cameras Racist?”](https://dcist.com/story/06/06/08/are-traffic-cam/) from the dcist, dates back to 2006. This story is mostly speculative and is not well sourced, but it is the first mention of residents complaining that traffic cameras were disproportionately located in the city’s African American neighborhoods.

What has not been done before & what angles could we take?

**Data Sets**

[Automated Traffic Enforcement Camera Locations](https://ddot.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ddot/publication/attachments/ATEB%20active%20locations%2009.01.2021%5B17%5D.pdf)

*District Department of Transportation (September 2021)*

This data set includes a list of all active Automated Photo Enforcement Cameras in the District, inlcuding cameras for red light enforcment, speed enforcement, stop signs and oversized vehicles, as of Sept. 1, 2021. This is the most recent data on traffic camera locations from the DDOT. This data set is trustworthy because it comes directly from the source and contains the most recently updated data available.

[District of Columbia Census Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/DC)

We can use Census data to look at the ethnic breakdown of D.C. districts and compare the data to that of other years and other major cities. Census data is typically the most trustworthy source for demographic data and can allow us to compare different sets of data to show demographic changes over time.

**Other Useful Tools**

[D.C. Health Matters Map](https://www.dchealthmatters.org/demographicdata/index/view?id=1502&localeTypeId=27)

This page from D.C. Health Matters breaks down data on the racial makeup of D.C.'s different wards and displays them in in interactive map.

[Traffic Camera Live Feeds](https://www.dctrafficinfo.org)

This website shows an interactive map of D.C. traffic cameras and allows viewers to tune into live video feeds of some of the cameras.
