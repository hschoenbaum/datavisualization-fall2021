# Assignment 2

## Are there more operating D.C. traffic cameras ticketing drivers in neighborhoods with a higher demographic of low-income people of color?

### Hannah Schoenbaum

**Summary**

*What has been done before?*

An investigation by the Washington Post, published on Aug. 6, 2021, did a deep dive into this issue. The article ["D.C. parking, traffic tickets snowball into financial hardships"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/08/06/dc-traffic-parking-tickets-black-neighborhoods/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_local) explains how WaPo collected and analyzed five years of traffic and parking enforcement data. "A Washington Post analysis of traffic tickets the District issued from 2016 through 2020 shows that 62 percent of all the fines from automated systems and D.C. police — $467 million — were issued in neighborhoods where Black residents make up at least 70 percent of the population and where the average median household income is below $50,000." The story includes interviews with several black residents and D.C. Council members, as well as multiple data visualizations. It is a very comprehensive story, and I wish I'd had time to read it before we initially pitched our ideas because I probably would have chosen to dive into a topic with less existing coverage.

Another earlier piece of coverage of racial disparities in D.C.’s traffic camera usage comes from a detailed 2018 study by research fellow William Farrell of the D.C. Policy Center, titled [“Predominately black neighborhoods in D.C. bear the brunt of automated traffic enforcement.”](https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/predominately-black-neighborhoods-in-d-c-bear-the-brunt-of-automated-traffic-enforcement/) In this study they author argues that "given the District’s high degree of residential racial segregation, decisions about where and how to use 'neutral' technology like speed cameras can still have a disparate impact in terms of outcomes." The D.C. Policy Center analyzed moving violation citations and crash data and concluded that census tracts with higher proportions of black residents were associated with a higher incidence of traffic fines, despite not experiencing a greater number of car crashes.

The earliest article I found on this topic, [“Are Traffic Cameras Racist?”](https://dcist.com/story/06/06/08/are-traffic-cam/) from the dcist, dates back to 2006. This story is mostly speculative and is not well sourced, but it is the first mention of residents complaining that traffic cameras were disproportionately located in the city’s African American neighborhoods.

*What has not been done before & what angles could we take?*

The Washington Post story was incredibly detailed and comprehensive, so I'm not sure there is much else we can do related to this topic. An interesting angle might be to follow the D.C. Auditor's recently launched 10-month investigation into the Vision Zero program, which was launched by Mayor Bowser in 2015 and aims to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2024. This article by the dcist - [D.C. Auditor Looking Into Vision Zero Program, Which Has Only Reduced Traffic Fatality Total Once In Six Years](https://dcist.com/story/21/09/22/d-c-auditor-looking-into-vision-zero-program-which-has-only-reduced-traffic-fatality-total-once-in-six-years/) - explains the ineffectiveness of the Vision Zero program thus far. I think we could potentially research what changes the city has made since the inception of the Vision Zero program, what changes are still to come, and what the auditor is investigating and explore the effect this program has had on improving or worsening racial disparities in ticketing. Because the Washington Post story was published so recently and includes data from the Vision Zero years, this might not be a unique enough angle. Another option might be to compare D.C. to other American cities with large black populations and explore trends in ticketing. I wonder if D.C. is ticketing via traffic cameras more than other major cities and why that is. I'm curious to hear what my classmates think about the existing coverage of this topic and whether they can think of any other unique angles or would rather pursue a topic that has gotten less media attention.

**Data Sets**

[Automated Traffic Enforcement Camera Locations](https://ddot.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ddot/publication/attachments/ATEB%20active%20locations%2009.01.2021%5B17%5D.pdf)

*District Department of Transportation (September 2021)*

This data set includes a list of all active Automated Photo Enforcement Cameras in the District, inlcuding cameras for red light enforcment, speed enforcement, stop signs and oversized vehicles, as of Sept. 1, 2021. This is the most recent data on traffic camera locations from the DDOT. This data set is trustworthy because it comes directly from the source and contains the most recently updated data available.

[District of Columbia Census Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/DC)

We can use Census data to look at the ethnic breakdown of D.C. districts and compare the data to that of other years and other major cities. Census data is typically the most trustworthy source for demographic data and can allow us to compare different sets of data to show demographic changes over time.

[Crashes in DC](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crashes-in-dc)

*Open Data DC*

This data set and interactive map log all of the car crash locations and details of each crash in the District. The data set is updated daily to include all new crash data. This data is trustworthy because it comes directly from the DDOT and is regularly updated. This data source was the same one used in the D.C. Policy Center study I referenced above.
