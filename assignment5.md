# Assignment 5: Sketch a visualization

[Data Visualization: Cocoa Bean Imports in 2019](https://github.com/hschoenbaum/datavisualization-fall2021/blob/main/Cocoa%20Bean%20Data%20Visualization%20-%20Hannah%20Schoenbaum.pdf)
You may view my data visualization at the link above. Once I learn how to use Tableau and other data visualization programs, I would want to add an interactive element to this visualization that would allow you to hover your cursor over the chocolate chips to see the exact number of imports (by tonnes) in each continent. I wanted to keep the visualization as simple as possible and focus on one year of imports instead of the changes over time because I think it's more newsworthy that Europe dominates the global imports.
