# Assignment 4: Interviewing a Data Set

## Step 1: A link to the dataset, your questions, as well as the answers to those questions.
 
 I searched for data sets on kaggle.com and decided on this set that details worldwide COVID-19 vaccination data. When I downloaded the data set and took my first glance at the categories and data available to me, I decided to explore the following three questions:
 
  * Which country was the first to report fully vaccinated individuals?

  * Which companyâ€™s vaccine was administered by the most countries worldwide?

  * Which country has the fewest number of vaccinated individuals per hundred residents?

After analyzing the data in Excel, I determined that BLANK was the first country to report fully vacinated individals. I also found that the COVID-19 vaccine produced by BLANk was administered by highest number of countries worldwide. Finally, I found that BLANK had the fewesr number of vaccinated individuals per 100 residents. In assessing the answers I found, I have decided that the third answer is probably the most newsworthy and should be the one I write about for Step 3. 

I was interested in the other two questions as well, but I think there are additional unanswered questions that make those two options less concrete. For instance, I'm not sure I could use the first answer to accurately determine which country had the very first fully vaccinated individuals because there were a lot of discrepancies between countries when it came to collecting and reporting vaccination data. As for the seconf answer, it's interesting to see which vaccine manufacturers had distribution deals with the most countries, but this question does not answer which manufacturer distributed the highest total number of vaccines. If I thought this question was more newsworthy, I would analyze that and ask some additional follow-up questions.

## Step 2: Write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas.


## Step 3: Write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.
