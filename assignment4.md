 When I downloaded the data set and took my first glance at the categories and data available to me, I decided to explore the following three questions:

  * Which companyâ€™s vaccine was administered by the most countries worldwide?

  * Which country has the fewest number of vaccinated individuals per hundred residents?

## Step 2: Write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas.
