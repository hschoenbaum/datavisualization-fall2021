[Cocoa Bean Imports Data Visualization](https://github.com/hschoenbaum/datavisualization-fall2021/blob/main/Assignment%206%20Visualization.png)

Here is the link to my graph detailing the global cocoa bean imports by region from 2015 to 2019. I reorganized the data in an Excel spreadsheet before upoading it into Datawrapper so that it was simplified into one column for each year and one row for each region. This allowed me to create a grouped column chart, broken down by year, so that I could compare the annual cocoa bean imports in each region. The total values appear when you hover your cursor over each column in Datawrapper, but I don't think you're able to see that in the .png version I've attached.
