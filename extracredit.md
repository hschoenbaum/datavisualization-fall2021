**Extra Credit Assignment**

Hannah Schoenbaum

For this assignment, I decided to create a visualization that would go along with the news of the new COVID-19 Omicron variant. Two flights from South Africa to the Netherlands carried 61 COVID-19-positive passengers last week, 13 of whom have tested positive for the Omicron variant so far, according to Dutch health authorities.
