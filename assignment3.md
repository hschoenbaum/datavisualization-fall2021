### We found two data sets

### Steps to clean data sets
* First we downloaded the data in a .csv file. 
* We looked at the data and decided on which headers we wanted.
* We then transposed the data so it would be thin and not thick (more rows, fewer columns). 
* We determined that the blank fields should stay blank and did not need to be filled in with an N/A.
* We filtered the data set to figure out which categorizations the original data set had included.
* We then filtered the original data into those separate categories (Bike/scooter IDs, IOS numbers, lattitude, longitude, rental URIS) and put that data into it's own respective sheet on Excel.
* Then, in a final sheet, we placed the data from each individual category into a column with a header so we could identify each independent scooter and its geographic data.
