### Data Story Critique

San Francisco Chronicle: [The Airbnb Effect](https://www.sfchronicle.com/airbnb-impact-san-francisco-2015/#1)

*Clarity and accuracy*

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.
 **4**
  * What was it?
   **The main data visualization in this story shows an interactive map of neighborhoods in San Francisco and breaks down the amount of Airbnb locations, the prices and the number of reviews left on the site, from 2014 to 2015. It was easy for me to identify the trends the reporter was trying to show - both the rise in prices and number of Airbnbs that have rapidly popped up in the city. The only element that was unclear to me was the breakdown by neighborhoods because, as someone who does not reside in San Francisco, I have little preexising knowledge about these neighborhoods and their affordability. There are also a few typos in the text component of the interactive map.**
 * Was it in the headline?
  **No. The headline was pretty vague, but he subheading did identify the central insight and sort of served as a lede.**
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent
 **4**
  * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?
   **I think an interactive map is the best way to compare data across different neighborhoods in a city. That being said, I would've appreciated more context about the neighborhoods (average income, housing affordability, etc.).**
  * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
   **I think the data visualization would be easier to digest if the viewer did not have to toggle between three different maps to view all the data. I think they could have done away with the "Reviews" map because that data set is not as helpful in conveying the central message of the story, and I think that extra data could be overwhelming or distracting to some readers.**
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate. 
 **4**
  * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
   **I question the accuracy of any data that wasn't obtained by the investigative team directly. The San Francisco Chronicle clearly states that they hired outside data-extraction firms to help them harvest the data, so I would want to do some research into those firms to make sur I'm getting trustworthy results.**
  * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.
   **I would suggest the reporter fact check the data with their own searches on Airbnb, to the best of their ability. I'm not sure who they reporter should go to for help fact checking this kind of data**
  * Did they provide a source?
   **They credited the data-extraction firms Connotate Inc. and Import.io with harvesting San Francisco listings from the Airbnb, HomeAway and FlipKey websites.** 
  * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?
   **I think, with exception to the background information on the neighborhoods, they did a good job explaining the data they were presenting and the trends they had found.**

*Quality*

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.
**4. I think the interactive map looks great and immediately draws me in to explore the data even further. As I mentioned before, I think the data could heve been merged into a single map, instead of three, to make it easier to navigate. The creators also need to fix a few typos in the text component of their data visualization.**


*Type and color (if piece includes graphics)*

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
  * For example, did it:
    * Look like it all belonged together?
    **Yes. The creators used different shades of yellow, orange and red on the map to show which neighborhoods had the most short-term rental properties and which had the highest average prices.**
    * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
    **My eye was drawn to the neighborhoods that were colored the darkest red color, which seems to have been the creators' intention because the red neighborhoods are those with the most short-term rental properties and highest average prices.** 
    * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
    **It makes sense, however, the color scheme they used reminds me of a heat map, which doesn't fit the themes of the story very well, in my opinion.**
* Type (1-5) - 
**4**
  * Explain
  **I think the type looks good because there is a nice variance in sizing and bolding. Plus, the map headline is in a serif font, while the rest of the data visualization uses a sans serif font. I think that provides a nice contrast.**
* Color (1-5) - 
**3**
  * Explain
  **I would stick with the color scale (light to dark) but switch up the colors themselves so it looks a little less like a heat map for a climate story.**

*Creativity*

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
  * How?
  **I think the map was a predictable type of data visualization for a local story like this, but it is done in a way that draws in interest to the story. I'm not the most knowledgeable on how to build an interactive map, but I think it could have been interesting to create an interactive map with some pins to specific Airbnb locations of interest, such as those charging the highest rate, and included photos. And, as I mentioned before, I think the "Reviews" map doesn't contribute much to the story and crowds the most important data.**
  * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. 
  **3.**


### Short Pitch for Final Project

*What interesting question you want to answer?*

**Are there more operating D.C. traffic cameras ticketing drivers in neighborhoods with a higher demographic of low-income people of color?**

*What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help you answer it?*

**I assume the D.C. police department would have data on where all the traffic cameras are located, which ones are active and how often they are giving out tickets. Demographic data from the city or the census could give me a breakdown of the average income and racial makeup of each D.C. neighborhood.**

*Why is this story timely now?*

**This story is timely because of the broader conversations our society is having about police presence in neighborhoods of color. It piggybacks off the BLM protests of last summer and is could be an important local story that holds the police and the city government accountable.**

*What types of people you could talk to for sources?*

* **I would want to interview someone in local government, such as a member of the D.C. City Council or someone at the mayor's office.**
* **I'd also want to speak to someone at the police department.**
* **I would visit neighborhoods with the highest number of operating traffic cameras and try to speak to residents of color who have received tickets from the cameras for some personal anecdotes.** 
* **I would also look into whether there were any local advocacy groups who could speak to this issue.**

*Anything else important to know?*

**I'm pitching this off of a hunch that there's a story here, but I can't be sure until I get ahold of the data. I'm hoping you can help me find some direction on where to start gathering that data. At the very least, D.C. is a city with a large African American population and a lot of opperating traffic cameras, so this could lead me to a data story that compares traffic camera presence in different U.S. cities that also have significant black populations (and potentially a lot fewer operating traffic cameras?).**
