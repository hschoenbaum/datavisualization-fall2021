**Data Story Critique**

*Clarity and accuracy*

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.
  * What was it?
Was it in the headline?
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent
  * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?
  * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
  * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
  * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.
  * Did they provide a source?
  * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

*Quality*

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.

*Type and color (if piece includes graphics)*

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
  * For example, did it:
    * Look like it all belonged together?
    * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
    * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
  * Explain
* Color (1-5)
  * Explain

*Creativity*

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
  * How?
  * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.


**Short Pitch for Final Project**

*What interesting question you want to answer?*

Are there more operating D.C. traffic cameras ticketing drivers in neighborhoods with a higher demographic of low-income people of color?

*What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help you answer it?*

I assume the D.C. police department would have data on where all the traffic cameras are located, which ones are active and how often they are giving out tickets. Demographic data from the city or the census could give me a breakdown of the average income and racial makeup of each D.C. neighborhood.

*Why is this story timely now?*

This story is timely because of the broader conversations our society is having about police presence in neighborhoods of color. It piggybacks off the BLM protests of last summer and is could be an important local story that holds the police and the city government accountable.

*What types of people you could talk to for sources?*

* I would want to interview someone in local government, such as a member of the D.C. City Council or someone at the mayor's office. 
* I'd also want to speak to someone at the police department. 
* I would visit neighborhoods with the highest number of operating traffic cameras and try to speak to residents of color who have received tickets from the cameras for some personal anecdotes. 
* I would also look into whether there were any local advocacy groups who could speak to this issue.

*Anything else important to know?*

I'm pitching this off of a hunch that there's a story here, but I can't be sure until I get ahold of the data. I'm hoping you can help me find some direction on where to start gathering that data. At the very least, D.C. is a city with a large African American population and a lot of opperating traffic cameras, so this could lead me to a data story that compares traffic camera presence in different U.S. cities that also have significant black populations (and potentially a lot fewer operating traffic cameras?).
