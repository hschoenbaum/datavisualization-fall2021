**Short Pitch for Final Project**

*What interesting question you want to answer?*

Are there more operating D.C. traffic cameras ticketing drivers in neighborhoods with a higher demographic of low-income people of color?

*What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help you answer it?*

I assume the D.C. police department would have data on where all the traffic cameras are located, which ones are active and how often they are giving out tickets. Demographic data from the city or the census could give me a breakdown of the average income and racial makeup of each D.C. neighborhood.

*Why is this story timely now?*

This story is timely because of the broader conversations our society is having about police presence in neighborhoods of color. It piggybacks off the BLM protests of last summer and is could be an important local story that holds the police and the city government accountable.

*What types of people you could talk to for sources?*

* I would want to interview someone in local government, such as a member of the D.C. City Council or someone at the mayor's office. 
* I'd also want to speak to someone at the police department. 
* I would visit neighborhoods with the highest number of operating traffic cameras and try to speak to residents of color who have received tickets from the cameras for some personal anecdotes. 
* I would also look into whether there were any local advocacy groups who could speak to this issue.

*Anything else important to know?*

I'm pitching this off of a hunch that there's a story here, but I can't be sure until I get ahold of the data. I'm hoping you can help me find some direction on where to start gathering that data. At the very least, D.C. is a city with a large African American population and a lot of opperating traffic cameras, so this could lead me to a data story that compares traffic camera presence in different U.S. cities that also have significant black populations (and potentially a lot fewer operating traffic cameras?).
